The “travel model ideal” was defined in NCHRP Report 765. The purpose of the “travel model ideal” was to provide a goal for model developers and to alert practitioners that travel models can satisfy the needs of project-level forecasts, under many circumstances. The ["Best practical experience model standard"](Best_practical_experience_model_standard_in_project_level_traffic_forecasting) is a more realistic design for travel models in many states that may be used for project-level travel forecasting.
