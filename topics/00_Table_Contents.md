## Principles and Concepts
This section deals with the behavioral and mathematical theory underlying travel
forecast models.

### Concepts of Travel Behavior
* Value of Time
* [Accessibility](Accessibility)
* [Induced Demand](Travel_Behavior_Definitions) / Derived Demand / Trip Purposes
* [Trip-based](Trip_based_models) and [Activity-based](Activity_based_models) distinctions

### Travel Behavior Models
* [Trip Generation](Trip_Generation)
* Daily activity patterns
* [Trip Distribution](Spatial_Interaction_Models)
* [Destination Choice](Destination_Choice_Models)
* [Mode Choice](Mode_choice)
* Time-of-day Choice
* [Static Assignment Theory](Network_assignment)
* [Dynamic Assignment Theory](Dynamic_Traffic_Assignment)
* [Land Use Models](Land_use_transport_modeling)

### Statistics / Econometrics
* Growth rate functions
* Iterative proportional fitting
* [Regression analysis](Regression_Analysis)
* [Choice models](Choice_Models)
* Advanced choice models
* Coordinated choice models
* Spatial interaction models
* Machine learning / artificial intelligence

## Model Development
This section deals with best practices for developing and delivering travel forecasting models.

### Model building blocks
* Travel behavior data: [Travel Behavior Definitions](Travel_Behavior_Definitions), [Travel Behavior](Travel_behavior), [Travel Behavior of Diverse Populations](Travel_Behavior_of_Diverse_Populations), [Travel Surveys](Travel_surveys)
* [Networks](Transportation_networks) and [Network Data](Spatial_Data.html#network-data)
* [Zones](Traffic_Analysis_Zone) and more generally [Spatial Data](Spatial_data)
* [Socioeconomic data](Spatial_Data.html#land-use-demographic-socio-economic-data)
* Software for model development
  - Commercial packages
  - Open-source languages
  - [Version Control](Version_Control)

### Model development techniques
* [Calibration and Validation](Model_calibration_and_validation)
  - [Choice models](Choice_models), [Choice Model Development in Practice](Choice_Model_Development_in_Practice), [Mode Choice Calibration and Validation](Mode_choice.html#calibration-validation)
  - [Destination choice models](Destination_Choice_Models), [Destination Choice Calibration and Validation](Destination_Choice_Calibration_and_Validation)
  - Highway Assignment: [Network Assignment](Network_assignment), [Stochastic Traffic Assignment](Stochastic_Traffic_Assignment) and [Dynamic Traffic Assignment](Dynamic_Traffic_Assignment)

### Mode-specific considerations
* [Freight modeling](Freight_modeling)
* [Public transport (transit) modeling](Public_transport_transit_modeling)
* Active transport (non-motorized) modeling: [Pedestrian Route Choice](Pedestrian_Route_Choice)
* Shared mobility
* [Autonomous vehicles](Autonomous_vehicles)
* Urban Air Mobility

## Model Application and Management
This section deals with using travel forecasting models within public agencies. Topics include:
* [Statewide models](Statewide_models)
* [Strategic models](Strategic_Models)
* Model peer review practices
* [Integrated models](Travel_Demand_and_Network_Model_Integration_Schemas), [Integrated_Travel_Demand_and_Network_Models](Integrated_Travel_Demand_and_Network_Models), [Model_integration](Model_integration)
