### Elderly

### Women

The literature has established that women in the U.S. tend to have more frequent, shorter trips than men. Women also tend to use transit more often than men.[^1]

Research by Susan Hanson found that, “Women with no children at home averaged a slightly longer commuting time than women with children, but still not as long on average as men. . The presence or absence of children had no effect on men's commuting time." [^2]
