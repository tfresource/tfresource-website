Bypasses of regional scope serve to relieve traffic congestion on a parallel road and to give drivers not needing to stop locally a faster alternative route to their destination. Such bypasses have more than a few intersecting streets and provide access to substantial swaths of land that are not accessible to the original route.

Bypasses of a regional scope require a depth of analysis provided by a travel forecasting model. The travel forecasting model may have already been developed for long-range planning, or the travel forecasting model could be developed specifically for this bypass. If applicable, a custom model could use either the windowing technique ([Windowing with OD table estimation from traffic counts](Windowing_with_OD_table_estimation_from_traffic_counts_in_project-level_traffic_forecasting)) or the subarea focusing technique ([Subarea focusing](Subarea_focusing_in_project-level_traffic_forecasting)).
The decision to use a custom model instead of an existing model depends upon the adequacy of the existing model. The existing model should be reviewed for:

-   Size of zones, for sufficient spatial precision;
-   Analysis time period, for sufficient temporal precision;
-   Delay relationships, for reasonable estimates of diversion due to congestion and traffic controls;
-   Validation accuracy on the original route and on major crossing arterials;
-   Age of input data.

In either case, the outputs of the selected travel forecasting model may be refined by comparison to screenline counts or to forecasts done by a statistical (e.g., time series) method.
