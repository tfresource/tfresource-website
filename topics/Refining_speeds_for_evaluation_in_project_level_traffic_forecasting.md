Guidelines
----------

Some post-processors used for evaluation require speeds at different times of day. Ideally, speeds should be estimated hour-by-hour within a travel model or by further analysis of hourly traffic volumes from another forecasting methodology. It is not possible to obtain hourly speeds directly from multihour (or 24-hour) forecasted volumes. If multihour speeds are needed, they should be calculated as the volume-weighted average of speeds across all hours in the time period.
