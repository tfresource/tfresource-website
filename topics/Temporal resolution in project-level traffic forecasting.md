Guidelines
==========

Forecasts may be made for 24-hours, a peak hour, a multihour peak or some other period of time. However, it is important to recognize that delay estimates over a period of time greater than a single hour are not sufficiently trustworthy for project-level work. Therefore, it is essential that a multihour period be modeled by consecutive individual hours. A multihour period may be assembled by combining several one-hour static traffic assignments or by a single dynamic traffic assignment that spans the whole period. Static traffic assignments of less than one hour are unusual.
