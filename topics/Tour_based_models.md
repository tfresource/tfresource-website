**Tour-based models** arrange travel into units called tours. Tours are travel events that start at one location and return to that same location. For example, when a person travels to work and returns home, this a home-based work tour. A tour can have two or more trips.

[Activity-based models](Activity_Based_Models) are tour-based, but a model does not have to be activity-based to be tour-based.

Terminology
===========

Sub-tours
---------

A sub-tour is a tour that occurs temporally within another tour. For example, if a worker goes from home to work, and goes from work to a restaurant back to work, and then goes back home, this activity chain contains one sub-tour.

Half-tours
----------

Each tour is divided into two **'half-tours**'- one from the primary origin to the primary destination, and one from the primary destination back to the origin.

Outbound/Inbound
----------------

The half-tour leaving from the primary origin is called **'outbound**. The half-tour leaving from primary destination is called **'inbound**'.

Intermediate stops
------------------

A tour may have zero or many **'intermediate stops**'. An intermediate stop occurs when a person participates in an activity at a location that is not the tour origin or destination. For example, if a person goes from home to work and picks up coffee along the way, the place where the person got the coffee is an intermediate stop.
