However, when generating a synthetic population, it is often desired to obtain a synthetic population whose characteristics mimic the joint distribution of attributes in the true population. In order to do this, the marginal distributions on control variables are processed iteratively to derive a joint distribution (across multiple dimensions) for the population at large. This iterative process is facilitated through the definition of a seed matrix derived from a sample data source. Microdata drawn from a survey or census sample (such as the Public Use Microdata Sample, or PUMS data in the United States) serves as a source for this seed matrix. The seed matrix is then expanded using the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) algorithm to obtain a population-wide joint distribution that adheres to the marginal control distributions. In the IPF algorithm, cell values in the seed matrix are amplified to iteratively match row totals and column totals that are available from the marginal distributions. The IPF algorithm converges when the expanded joint distribution provides row and column totals that match the univariate marginal distributions within an acceptable tolerance level, a very small value usually specified by the analyst. The synthetic population is generated such that amplified cell totals in the joint distribution of marginal control variables (derived from IPF procedure) are matched.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"resources"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#resources"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Resources")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"Population_Synthesis_For_Microsimulating_Travel_Behavior"}},[e._v("Population Synthesis For Microsimulating Travel Behavior")])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"Synthetic_populations_review_of_the_different_approaches"}},[e._v("Synthetic populations: review of the different approaches")])]),e._v(" "),a("hr")])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
