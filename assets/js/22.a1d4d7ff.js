The University of Texas at Austin and the North Central Texas Council of Governments served as co-hosts of the first conference. The inaugural conference of the ITM series was a grand success with more than 150 attendees, including leading academics, practitioners from private and public sector entities, and policy makers. The conference program included several presentations by leading researchers from around the world, thus offering a global perspective on innovations in travel modeling. Interactive sessions and informal networking events provided ample opportunities for attendees to learn from one another and discuss ways to transition advanced methods and algorithms into practice. There was considerable discussion related to the objectives, aims, and goals of the conference series and the type of work that would be presented at the conference. It was largely felt that the conference should focus on methods, algorithms, and modeling techniques in the research domain that show considerable promise for implementation in practice in the near-term.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The proceedings of the conference have been published in a two-volume series.")]),e._v(" "),t("ul",[t("li",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conf/CP42.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Volume 1: Session Summaries"),t("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),t("li",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conf/CP42v2.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Volume 2: Papers"),t("OutboundLink")],1),e._v("\\")])]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The final conference program and the call for papers may be accessed at the following links:")]),e._v(" "),t("ul",[t("li",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"http://itm2010.weebly.com/uploads/5/0/5/4/5054275/itm2006austinprogram.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Final Conference Program"),t("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),t("li",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"http://itm2010.weebly.com/uploads/5/0/5/4/5054275/innovations_in_travel_modeling_austin_2006_call_for_papers.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("ITM2006 Call for Papers"),t("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The idea for the Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference Series was born in about 2003-2004, as an initiative led by the Committee on Transportation Demand Forecasting (ADB40, Chair: Chandra R.
