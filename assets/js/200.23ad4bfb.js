While helping developing and supporting dozens transportation models on the TRACC’s cluster computer and collaborating with state Dots, MPOs and academia it became obvious that model integration is the item that requires a large amount of time and other resources to accomplish. FHWA’s office of planning had a vision to develop a prototype (proof of concept) of an integrated model that would allow having different transportation models (traffic flow, intersection control, demand generation, operations, etc.) to interoperate and form an integrated model. At the beginning of the project the Argonne team organized a one day workshop on integrated transportation models (http://tinyurl.com/orac4zh) and gathered transportation engineers and scientists who are currently on the frontier of the developing and implementing integrated models. It helped the team to refine the technical scope of the project and identify ways to tackle the problem. The agent-based modeling technique was chosen to be used for the new model. Argonne has a long history of successfully developing agent-based models for political and social processes, logistics, urban dynamics, business applications, geographical systems and economics. The experience accumulated at Argonne helped the team to design the simulation framework in which traveler agents have behavioral responses and are sensitive to the actions of other agents, which may range from other travelers, to system managers and smart infrastructure, or even to the overall system performance.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"purpose-and-function"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#purpose-and-function"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Purpose and Function")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("The focus of the POLARIS suite is to support the evaluation of relevant program issues at regional scale, notably planning for operations and emerging vehicle and roadside technologies.

The demand components, including activity generation and activity planning, are also responsive to network and traffic management events, which can result in agent replanning.

Each HAR and VMS can display/broadcast a single message associated with a network event. Five types of network events can be modeled by the network events manager: weather, accidents, congestion, lane closure, and travel time.
