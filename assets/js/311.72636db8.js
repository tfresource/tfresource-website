As shown in the figure below, one of the possible solutions is to employ DTA to produce aggregate Level of Service (LOS) matrices (the way they are produced by STA), and use these LOS variables to feed the demand model. This approach, however, would lose most of the details associated with DTA and the advantages of individual microsimulation (such as the individual variation in Values of Time or other person characteristics). In this approach, the individual schedule consistency concept is of limited value because travel times will be very crude for each particular individual. Nevertheless, this approach has been adopted in many studies due to its inherent simplicity (Bekhor et al. 2011, Castiglione 2012). The emphasis in these studies was to use more disaggregation in the LOS skims – many more time periods, smaller zones and several VOT classes.

The first solution is based on the fact that a direct integration at the disaggregate level is possible along the temporal dimension if the other dimensions (number of trips, order of trips, and trip destinations) are fixed for each individual. Then, full advantage can be taken of the individual schedule constraints and corresponding effects. The inner loop of temporal equilibrium includes schedule adjustments in individual daily activity patterns as a result of congested travel times being different from the planned travel times. The integration helps the DTA to reach convergence (internal loop), and is nested within the global system loop (where the entire ABM is rerun and demand is regenerated to approach an equilibrium between demand and supply). The second solution is based on the fact that trip origins, destinations, and departure times can be pre-sampled and the DTA process would only be required to produce trajectories for a subset of origins, destinations, and departure times. In this case, the schedule consolidation is implemented by corrections of the departure and arrival times (based on the individually simulated travel times) and is employed as an inner loop. The outer loop includes a full regeneration of daily activity patterns and schedules but with a sub-sample of locations for which trajectories are available. This integration also can be interpreted as a learning and adaptation process with limited information).")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("img",{attrs:{src:"NewIntegrationMethods.jpg",alt:"Advanced integration method of Activity-based models and Dynamic Traffic Assignments",title:"fig:NewIntegrationMethods.jpg"}})]),e._v(" "),a("h3",{attrs:{id:"practical-convergence-methods"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#practical-convergence-methods"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Practical Convergence Methods")]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"averaging"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#averaging"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Averaging")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("These methods have been borrowed from conventional trip-based modeling techniques, but can be used with microsimulation as well, as long as they are applied to continuous outputs/inputs like LOS variables and/or synthetic trip tables generated by the Moving Successive Averaging (MSA).
