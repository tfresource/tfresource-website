From the earliest models, delay was estimated using volume-delay functions (VDFs) – the most popular and well recognized VDF being the “BPR curve”. (BPR is an acronym for the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor agency to the Federal Highway Administration.) The BPR curve satisfied a number of important requirements that were imposed by travel models as they existed through the 1980’s. It is a smooth, increasing monotonic function between delay and volume on a link. It could compute a travel time for each possible volume, and it could be integrated in closed form (a mathematical operation) that was essential to user-equilibrium traffic assignment algorithms that were formulated as minimization problems.
