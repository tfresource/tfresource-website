Discrete choice models, such as the multinomial logit model, nested logit model, and the ordered probit model, are often used to predict the alternative that an individual will choose from among a choice set of alternatives. In situations where a continuous budget is allocated to different alternatives, the fractional split or amount allocated to each alternative may be modeled using a fractional logit model. In many instances, however, individuals are faced with choices that involve multiple discrete alternatives with each alternative consumed to a different extent. In such cases, individuals choose one or more alternatives from the choice set and then consume each of the alternatives chosen to a different degree. Thus there is multiple discreteness in the choice process, with a continuous dimension defined by the amount of consumption. Because the fractional logit model does not quite accommodate multiple discreteness and does not adequately handle corner solutions where some alternatives are not chosen or consumed at all, a need arose for a multiple discrete-continuous choice model that is computationally tractable. Such choice phenomena cannot be modeled using traditional single discrete choice models because the number of mutually exclusive composite alternatives explodes as the number of alternatives in the choice set becomes large. The multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model was developed by Bhat (2005, 2008) to address this need and the model has become quite popular as the modeling methodology of choice when dealing with multiple discrete-continuous choice phenomena. The methodology offers appealing behavioral features, a closed form expression for the likelihood function, and computational tractability that are all contributing to its increased application in models in practice.

The original formulation of the MDCEV model tightly couples the decisions related to the choice of discrete alternatives and the continuous consumption quantities. As a result, the classic MDCEV model generally estimates the continuous consumption quantities well, but not the discrete choice decisions. An increase in the probability of choosing a discrete alternative is simultaneously associated with an increase in the consumption quantity for that alternative, which may not necessarily hold true in all choice contexts - leading to potentially erroneous forecasts. Bhat (2017) suggests that the original MDCEV model formulation is likely better characterized as a multiple continuous (MC) model because it estimates the continuous consumption quantity accurately at the expense of the discrete alternatives. Moreover, the classic MDCEV model does not offer a mechanism to just predict the choice of multiple discrete alternatives from a choice set without the need for information about continuous consumption quantities. The new formulation offers this ability, thus eliminating the need for data about a continuous budget and its allocation among multiple alternatives in the choice set. In the new robust and flexible "true" MDCEV model, Bhat (2017) uses a linear utility function for the first outside good and employs separate baseline utilities for the discrete and continuous consumption decisions.
