The point where these two travel time curves meet is the user equilibrium condition, where travel time on both links is equal (i.e. 1.333 minutes represented by green line). At this UE point, the traffic volume on link 1 is 2686 and traffic volume on link 2 is 314. Any other allocation of traffic between these two links results in unequal travel time and violates above mentioned Wardrop’s criteria. It is also important to note that, at this UE condition, the estimated traffic on link 1 is higher than assumed link capacity. This is one of the weaknesses frequently brought up in many transportation planning studies. Therefore, the estimated traffic volume and travel time are also interpreted as magnitude of total demand and the extent of congestion in model application scenarios.
