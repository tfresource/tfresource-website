However, as travel demand models have become increasingly sophisticated, parking surveys are also being used to provide additional travel behavior data for input into the modeling proc­ess. For example, parking generation surveys can improve the travel model calibration process by identifying and matching the demand and supply of vehicle trips generated to and from parking facilities located within specific traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Parking pricing surveys can also provide a more sophisticated understanding of the price elasticities of parking costs that greatly affect mode choice and consequently, travel behavior.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Parking surveys conducted to improve the travel modeling process are similar to "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"Establishment_surveys"}},[e._v("workplace or establishment surveys")]),e._v(", in that trip-makers are usually surveyed at the attraction end of their trip.
