In a rating experiment each alternatives must be classified using a scale which measures its attractiveness to the respondent. An example of a choice-based experiment is shown in Figure 21.1, where the objective is to understand how respondents make the choice between the automobile and bus alternative.

The respondent would consider two choice alternatives, and then be asked to imagine that the cost of one of the alternatives changes and indicate at what level he or she would switch to the other alternative. For example, auto commuters could be asked to consider their best transit option and indicate how high fuel prices would have to rise before they would switch to commuting by transit. This method thus gives a direct quantitative measure of the difference in utility between two alternatives, but it has been questioned whether or not travelers can respond very accurately to such questions.

It is difficult to make general statements about the validity of SP research, however, because the validity of any particular study depends mainly on the quality and care with which the experiment is conceived, designed, and administered. This is partly a science, but also an art to some extent, and often there is no substitute for experience when it comes to surveys and market research. Therefore, it is very difficult to design and carry out meaningful SP research without obtaining at least some advice and input from persons and/or firms who have experience with this specific type of survey.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("It is sometimes claimed that SP methods tend to produce mode-specific biases (alternative-specific constants) for new transit modes that are unrealistically high, particularly when they are divided by the time or cost coefficients and interpreted in terms of dollars or minutes advantage. One possible reason for “optimistic” forecasts of transit use with SP methods is “non-commitment” bias—the fact that respondents in hypothetical situations can imagine the attractive features of having a new transit alternative available, and can indicate that they would use the new service without having to actually commit themselves to the inconvenience and uncertainty of shifting to a new mode of travel. In actual situations, people may find it more difficult to change their habitual travel patterns. This potential problem with SP methods has long been recognized, and has been a major impetus for improvements in survey and design methods to make the experiments as realistic as possible. As described earlier, this can be done by customizing the choice context and attribute levels to mirror trips that respondents have actually made, and by prompting respondents to recall any choice constraints or circumstances of their actual trip that would make it difficult for them to change to another mode. Even with the most realistic, customized surveys, however, it is likely that some potential for non-commitment bias still exists.

In this case, however, the bias will tend to be negative, with SP respondents perhaps less receptive to using tolled facilities in the hypothetical contexts than they would be in reality. It may also be more difficult to avoid or measure using a method such as the “cheap talk” approach described earlier, as it would seem more difficult to influence what tends to be a political or attitudinal phenomenon using simple verbal instructions. It may be more effective, in fact, to include a series of attitudinal questions to identify respondents who are most fervently opposed to the introduction of tolls, and then to estimate a different bias constant for such individuals.
