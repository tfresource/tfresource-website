There are several aspects of modeling freight that make it fundamentally different than modeling person travel. Most fundamentally, moving freight over a network typically involves multiple persons (here called "agents") making a sequence of transactional decisions in a business environment. These agents can include (but are not limited to) persons working as manufacturers, shippers, carriers, purchasers and consumers. We may safely assume that the individual choices made by freight agents are rational in much the same way we assume that individual commuters maximize their utility when making travel mode, destination and network choices. But while the travel choice of an individual person represents a complete and self-contained economic transaction, the sequence of choices made by individual freight agents moving a single commodity from raw material to final consumer are strung together into what is called the "'),i("a",{attrs:{href:"Supply_chain"}},[e._v(" supply chain")]),e._v('".
