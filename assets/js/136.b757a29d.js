A proposed framework for the choice process is that an individual first determines the available alternatives; next, evaluates the attributes of each alternative relevant to the choice under consideration; and then, uses a decision rule to select an alternative from among the available alternatives (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985, Chapter 3).   Some individuals might select a particular alternative without going through the structured process presented above.  For example, an individual might decide to buy a car of the same make and model as a friend because the friend is happy with the car or is a car expert.  Or an individual might purchase the same brand of ice cream out of habit.

A common characteristic in the study of choice is that different decision makers face different choice situations and can have different tastes (that is, they value attributes differently).  For example, in travel mode choice modeling, two individuals with different income levels and different residential locations are likely to have different sets of modes to choose from and may place different importance weights on travel time, travel cost and other attributes.

However, even if an alternative is present in the universal choice set, it may not be feasible for a particular individual.  Feasibility of an alternative for an individual in the context of travel mode choice may be determined by legal regulations (a person cannot drive alone until the age of 16), economic constraints (limousine service is not feasible for some people) or characteristics of the individual (no car available or a handicap that prevents one from driving).  The subset of the universal choice set that is feasible for an individual is defined as the feasible choice set for that individual.
