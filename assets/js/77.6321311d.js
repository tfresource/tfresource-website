These factors are estimated in a statistically rigorous way to allow the model to reproduce expanded big OD data with minimal error. Fixed factors or constants can be specific to individual or groups of origins or destinations or OD pairings.

Despite this important distinction, some historical abuses of k factors still make some professionals hesitant or fearful of constant rich approaches. Individuals with a classical statistical background may also have a hesitancy due to fears of over-specification errors. However, while errors and abuse are possible in any statistical modeling, and some level of caution is always an important component in good judgment, in the new context of the availability of Big Data, conscientious professionals should reconsider constant rich approaches in an open and unbiased way. The emergence of a new generation of constant rich approaches is driven by a real change in the context of the data and analysis methods available, the evaluation of which is should not be overly burdened by data-poor and poorly structured use of k factors that bear little resemblance to contemporary methods.
