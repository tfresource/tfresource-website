This\nproject includes research that has combined tour based truck models and logistics supply chain\nmodels for urban commercial vehicle movements and that has demonstrated a functional model\nframework that addresses the limitations of current freight demand forecasting models. The research\nwas performed by Resource Systems Group Inc., in partnership with the Chicago Metropolitan Agency\nfor Planning and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The project introduced a model framework and\nfocused on the estimation of each of the model components, described the approach to linking the\nmodels together in the model application, and presented initial results from applying the model in the\nChicago region. The models were estimated for demonstration purposes from several sources, since\nthere were no datasets that could support all aspects of the new framework. To make the demonstration\nmore practical, two commodities were chosen to model from the data available (food products and\nmanufactured products). The models developed for the project were applied using software\ndeveloped in R, an open source platform. A data collection program to support the estimation,\ncalibration, and forecasting of the framework for future use was recommended. Further efforts to\nimprove this framework with new data, model improvements, and forecasts would be welcome.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("This paper is part of a special issue on the Fourth Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference")]),e._v(" "),o("h4",{attrs:{id:"copyright-usage-permissions"}},[o("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#copyright-usage-permissions"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Copyright & Usage Permissions")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("This paper is part of a special issue on the Fourth Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference published online in Transportation Letters.
