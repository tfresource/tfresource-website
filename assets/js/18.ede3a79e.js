The planning process must now provide a variety of specific values for air quality analysis, evaluation of non-highway investments and transport policies, and support of integrated regional and statewide transportation improvement efforts. New demands on travel demand models include anticipation of congestion pricing impacts, details of trip timing and peak spreading, greenhouse gas emissions, non-motorized travel choices, emergency response, and freight movement, among other behaviors.  The Transportation Research Board's Special Report on Metropolitan Travel Forecasting (TRB 2007) concludes that there is a need to improve the state of metropolitan travel forecasting and that the data used in such models are lacking or questionable.

Current transportation planning models rely to a great extent on the disaggregate behavioral travel data obtained from travel surveys for establishing trip generation, trip distribution, mode split, trip scheduling, vehicle ownership, tolling response, and other important relationships. Of course, the next generation of travel models will also rely extensively on very detailed household level analyses (Shunk 1994). In fact, given the level of detail required by the newer, activity-based and/or microscopic models of travel choices, the data demands will likely be greater - in terms of route choice and location reporting details.
