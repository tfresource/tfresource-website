The gravity model often times exhibits incorrect demand elasticities; in particular, the model may respond illogically to changes in levels of service where improved accessibility to a given destination may cause a disproportionate increase in total trips, and/or an increase in trips using the mode(s) whose accessibility did not change. Both of these results are undesirable and may lead to erroneous assessments of the impact of transit or highway improvements. Destination choice models can overcome these gravity model limitations. With appropriate specifications of utility, consistency between changes in levels of service and changes in demand can be assured when using well validated destination choice models. In addition, because the functional form of the destination choice utility is very flexible, accounting for singularities in the trip distribution pattern can be accomplished in intuitive ways. For example, to inform a gravity model of the presence of a natural barrier, such as a river, a K-factor is often used.
