This population group includes low-income\nindividuals, minority individuals, elderly persons, children, people with LEP, and/or persons with disabilities. An equitable transportation plan\nconsiders the circumstances that impact a community’s mobility and connectivity needs, and this information is used to determine the measures needed\nto develop an equitable transportation network.

Income-based\nequity analyses are particularly straightforward since synthetic household data relies on income as an important predictor in many choice models such as\nvehicle ownership and mode choice. ABM outputs can be aggregated by income classes to understand how lower-income households are affected by projects.\nFor example, accessibility to jobs can be compared across income groups to determine who is primarily benefiting from a long-range transportation plan.\nWhile income is frequently available in ABM data, other important variables such as race, disability status, English proficiency and other data are\ntypically not included in standard synthetic person and household inputs. It is possible to control for some of these in population synthesizers, but\nthere is little existing precedent for these types of analysis. One of the main reasons these variables are not included is simply because demographic\nforecasts are not available for them. For instance, it is possible to have a synthetic population including race for a model base year, but few\nimplementations of land use and population forecasting tools (such as UrbanSim) consider race and other variables when forecasting populations.\nIn lieu of using ABM outputs directly, a more generic approach is to identify geographies with higher concentrations of People of Color, Lower\nIncome Households, or any equity indicator available in the data. This technique works for both ABM and 4-step models, since zones could be defined\nas specific TAZs.\nOne issue with using pre-defined geographies is that results shown for that area are only reporting an average and are not specifically representing\nthe targeted equity group. For instance, if a Census tract is identified to be majority People of Color, the entirety of that tract will likely not\nfit that definition, so behaviors are not a true representation of that equity population.

Given dramatic demographic shifts due to gentrification and displacement observed in many\nareas, the assumption that existing equity populations remain in the same location over multiple decades is problematic. However, this method does\nprovide some data to perform relative comparisons in the base year and some context for understanding the impact of displacement on these locations\nover time.
