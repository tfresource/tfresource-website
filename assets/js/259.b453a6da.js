In rural areas, which represent a large percentage of lane miles in statewide models, the percentage of truck trips is generally higher than what is found in urban settings and thus it is important to properly reflect this in the capacity of network links, speed/delay functions, and passenger car equivalents. With large segments of highway traversing mountainous regions, percent grade is more likely a factor on speed and capacity than what is found in a typical urban model.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Validation of statewide models is more challenging than urban and regional models due to several factors. The first of these is the multi-centric nature of statewide models, which are generally comprised of multiple urbanized areas. The gravity model tends to distribute trips among these MPO areas at a much higher rate than would typically occur in a smaller multi-centric region. A second issue is the difficulty of validating traffic counts on low volume roadways. With a larger share of low volume roadways in a statewide model network, it becomes difficult to achieve volume-over-count ratios and percent root mean square error standards typically achieved in the validation of urban and regional models. A third issue is that the aggregate network and zone structures found in statewide models make it difficult to validate traffic counts as a single roadway might take the place of multiple parallel routes found in an urban model. Thus, consideration should be given to limiting statewide model validation in urban settings to highway segments with few parallel routes such as bridges, mountain passes, and urbanized boundaries.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("The report titled NCHRP Project 836-B Task 91: Validation and Sensitivity Considerations for Statewide Models includes additional guidance on the validation of statewide models, along with metrics culled from a number of statewide models from across the U.S. A link to this document is "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/NCHRP08-36(91)_FR.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("here."),a("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"statewide-models-resources"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#statewide-models-resources"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Statewide Models: Resources")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("This section contains a link to the Statewide Modeling Subcommittee and a link to Statewide Modeling Case Studies.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"Statewide_Modeling_Subcommittee_ADA10_2"}},[e._v("Statewide_Modeling_Subcommittee_ADA10_2_")]),e._v(") is the link for all information on the Statewide Modeling Subcommittee.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"Statewide_Modeling_Case_Studies"}},[e._v("Statewide Modeling Case Studies")]),e._v(" is the link for all information on Statewide Modeling Case Studies.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"references"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#references"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" References")]),e._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[e._v("Cambridge Systematics, "),a("em",[e._v("National Travel Demand Forecasting Model Phase I Final Scope")]),e._v(", Transportation Research Board, Washington DC 2008.
