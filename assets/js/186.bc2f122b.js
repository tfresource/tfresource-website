GPS data can have multiple uses beyond traditional applications such as estimates of speed and travel times. GPS-related data that have been collected from automatic vehicle location systems, from highway sensors, as supplemental information to traditional travel surveys, and via passive technologies [e.g., Bluetooth, radio frequency identification (RFID), and smartphones] have shown promise for additional planning purposes. Some challenges to increased use of GPS data include\naddressing data bias; balancing precision, coverage, and confidentiality; resolving institutional issues such as data ownership; and addressing the complexity of combining these data with other sources to discern behavioral relationships.
