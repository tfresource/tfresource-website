The choice models included in such models are considerably more sophisticated than those found in aggregate models, even though most could also be implemented within a trip-based modeling framework. One of the more common additional data requirements is the classification of households and businesses by occupational categories, in addition to industry classification.

Such a gradual transition typically starts with the implementation of synthetic populations and replacement of the trip generation module with a daily activity patterns model.
