A further interest is to determine the relative influence of different attributes of alternatives and characteristics of decision makers when they make choice decisions.  For example, transportation analysts may be interested in predicting the fraction of commuters using each of several travel modes under a variety of service conditions, or marketing researchers may be interested in examining the fraction of car buyers selecting each of several makes and models with different prices and attributes.  Further, they may be interested in predicting this fraction for different groups of individuals and identifying individuals who are most likely to favor one or another alternative.

First, the disaggregate approach explains why an individual makes a particular choice given her/his circumstances and is, therefore, better able to reflect changes in choice behavior due to changes in individual characteristics and attributes of alternatives.  The aggregate approach, on the other hand, rests primarily on statistical associations among relevant variables at a level other than that of the decision maker; as a result, it is unable to provide accurate and reliable estimates of the change in choice behavior due changes in service or in the population.  Second, the disaggregate approach, because of its causal nature, is likely to be more transferable to a different point in time and to a different geographic context, a critical requirement for prediction.  Third, discrete choice models are being increasingly used to understand behavior so that the behavior may be changed in a proactive manner through carefully designed strategies that modify the attributes of alternatives which are important to individual decision makers.  The disaggregate approach is more suited for proactive policy analysis since it is causal, less tied to the estimation data and more likely to include a range of relevant policy variables.  Fourth, the disaggregate approach is more efficient than the aggregate approach in terms of model reliability per unit cost of data collection.  Disaggregate data provide substantial variation in the behavior of interest and in the determinants of that behavior, enabling the efficient estimation of model parameters.  On the other hand, aggregation leads to considerable loss in variability, thus requiring much more data to obtain the same level of model precision.  Finally, disaggregate models, if properly specified, will obtain un-biased parameter estimates, while aggregate model estimates are known to produce biased (i.e. incorrect) parameter estimates.")]),e._v(" "),i("h2",{attrs:{id:"use-of-disaggregate-discrete-choice-models"}},[i("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#use-of-disaggregate-discrete-choice-models"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Use of Disaggregate Discrete Choice Models")]),e._v(" "),i("p",[e._v("The behavioral nature of disaggregate models, and the associated advantages of such models over aggregate models, has led to the widespread use of disaggregate discrete choice methods in travel demand modeling.
