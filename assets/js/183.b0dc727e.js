The land use and network inputs that go into future scenario forecasts are uncertain, as are the form and parameter values of the statistical models that comprise a travel demand modeling system. In spite of this uncertainty, the practice in travel demand forecasting has been to generate a point estimate of highway loads, transit ridership, and other critical decision-making statistics. During the past few years, the modeling community has been highlighting the need to move away from treating model outputs as point forecasts and moving towards explaining them as ranges of possible outcomes with associated confidence intervals. With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting travel and activity patterns of people across the globe, the importance of highlighting the uncertainty around travel model forecasts is higher than ever.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Modeling practitioners today are in need of the resources and guidance to practically model uncertainty.
