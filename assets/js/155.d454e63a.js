Performance measures should preferably be calculated from real-world data. It is possible for a travel forecasting model and its post-processors to compute MOEs that resemble performance measures. This section will deal mainly with MOEs.\nStandard MOEs from travel models include vehicle-hours-travel and vehicle-miles-traveled.
