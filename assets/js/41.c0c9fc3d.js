In particular, on how the existence of AV may impact these behaviors. The essential change to the transport system that CAVs bring is their potential to make auto travel more convenient on a number of levels. As one no longer has to execute the driving task, this reduces driver fatigue, increases safety, and allows for the traveler to engage in other activities (multitasking). Further, as the car can travel without a human driver backup, the car can drop travelers directly at the destination, be sent on errands, carry those who cannot themselves drive (children, disabled, elderly), and relocate itself to coordinate travel for multiple people. In the absence of opposing forces such as congestion, pricing, infrastructure prioritization, or major land use restructuring, this increasing ease of auto travel will likely lead to more consumption (i.e. more auto travel).")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("To begin to understand the magnitude of the increase in travel, and the potential for policy to influence this increase, it is necessary to dig down into the specific behavioral shifts from which this increased travel occurs.

The “length” of the decision reflects how easy it is for a person to make adjustments, and therefore how quickly such behavioral changes will be realized in the system after CAVs are introduced. For example, leaving 30 minutes earlier is a relatively easy adjustment, so classified as a short-term decision that is expected to happen relatively quickly after the introduction of CAVs (months); moving residential location is hard and happens less frequently, so a long-term decision that will take some time (years, decades) for adjustments to be realized after CAVs are introduced.

In a classic modeling framework, this includes selection and location of discretionary activities (i.e., non-work) and the timing, mode, and route by which all activities (including mandatory activities) are accessed. All of these aspects may be influenced by the introduction of AVs. The increased ease of travel by auto may lead to more trips generated (i.e., activity/trip generation), for example by those who currently are not able to drive (due to age restrictions or disabilities); by lowering the impedance of more difficult trips such as longer trips, evening trips, activities leading to driving impairment (e.g., alcohol); by sending the AV on errands; or by replacing online ordering/delivery with AV pickup. The introduction of CAVs will also impact mode choices, shifting more travel to auto from other modes. The alternatives in the CAV future to which these shifts will occur will include options for self-owned CAVs as well as fleets of shared CAVs that can be used either solo or being pooled with other travelers. The CAVs can either be used for the entire trip or to link (either access or egress) to transit alternatives. The destinations of activities are also likely to change, with the increased ease of auto travel leading to longer trips (i.e., farther activities). Finally, the timing of trips may adjust as the sensitivity, for example, to peak period congestion may be lessened. The route can also be impacted depending on restrictions of roadway segments. More generally, there may be broader changes in trip-chaining and tours due to the ability of the CAV to shuttle multiple people among destinations, to relocate independently, and to drive people who used to have to be driven.

However, there is a rich travel behavior literature that is being leveraged on related topics such as pricing, multitasking, parking, travel budgets, modal attitudes, habits, etc. With this knowledge base, there are a wide range of adjustments that can be made to the models to reflect CAV impacts. These include making adjustments to model parameters (such as increasing trip generation rates or reducing travel time sensitivities in mode, destination, and residential location models), reducing alternative availability limitations (e.g., allowing independent private auto use for people without licenses), adding new alternatives (such as CAV in a mode choice or auto ownership model), or developing new behavioral models (such as automated parking behavior, errand running by CAV, intra-household coordination of household CAV, or privately owned vs shared CAV use). Further, current modeling efforts on TNCs (Uber, Lyft, etc.) and the infusion of these new mobility alternatives into the models help provide a framework for introducing CAV elements into travel demand models. In addition, new behavioral experiments are being developed to particularly target CAV behaviors. These include stated preference and willingness to pay studies asking about hypothetical CAV future scenarios, field tests using current day analogies (e.g., TNCs and chauffeurs), and gaming and virtual reality. As more of behavioral knowledge is acquired and compiled, more thoughtful adjustments can able to be made to the travel demand models. Some variables that are critical to forecasting the potential outcome are at this point very difficult to predict, such as the relative market shares of privately-owned CAVs and shared CAVs (which is also particularly contentious). For parameters such as this, it perhaps makes more sense to treat it as an exogenous, scenario level variable rather than endogenously predicting it.
