As a result of a Metropolitan Planning Organization travel demand model peer review conducted by TRB in 2003, it became clear that at that time, little information was available to practitioners to assist them in making judgements about state-of-the-practice techniques for model development and application. The peer review committee had to rely on their judgement to make this technical evaluation, rather than on detailed information on how key technical issues were treated by the MPOs peers. This lack of information prompted FHWA, FTA and TRB to conduct this study to gather the information needed to determine the national state-of-the-practice in travel demand forecasting.
